# 1.23.2 hotfix 1

These release notes are for a hotfix release for Anbox Cloud 1.23.2 to work around the [LP #2083961](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/2083961) bug in [snapd](https://github.com/canonical/snapd).

The only updated component is the [`ams-lxd` charm](https://charmhub.io/ams-lxd). The version of the updated charm is `1.23.2-40ab511`. You can find the updated list of component versions for the 1.23.2 at {ref}`ref-component-versions` .

The fixed problem manifests itself in the `ams-lxd` charm running into error status when trying to perform a reload of the `lxd.daemon` systemd service unit. The charm invokes `snap restart --reload lxd.daemon` for this which causes a failure on the systemd side as it is attempting to restart more than the necessary units. In order to mitigate the problem, until it is fixed in snapd, the `ams-lxd` charm has been updated to reload LXD by running `systemctl reload-or-restart snap.lxd.daemon.service` instead.

## Upgrade instructions
