# 1.15.3

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.15.3.

Note that this is an out of order release that only applies to the Anbox Cloud Appliance.

Please see {ref}`ref-component-versions` for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

* Work around a bug in Juju 2.9.35 that prevents the Anbox Cloud Appliance from deploying its software stack entirely. The workaround makes the deployment process independent of the Juju snap that is installed on the host system by including a Juju binary of a previous release inside the appliance snap.

## Bugs

* [LP:1993137](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1993137) Juju 2.9.35 breaks LXD deployment

## Upgrade instructions

See {ref}`howto-upgrade-anbox-cloud` or {ref}`howto-upgrade-appliance` for instructions on how to update your Anbox Cloud deployment to the 1.15.3 release.
