## Bugs

* LP #1927676 No image is imported in AMS when deploying 1.9.x based Anbox Cloud 

    With Anbox Cloud 1.10 packages are now version specific which allows users to deploy older versions of Anbox Cloud while a newer version is available. Due to a bug in AMS 1.9.x no images were imported as the 1.10 ones were always seen as newer (when `images.version_lockstep` is set to `true`) and older 1.9.x images were not considered. With 1.9.5 AMS will now correctly download the latest 1.9.x image and ignore any newer one.

    Existing deployments based on 1.9.x are not affected by this bug.
