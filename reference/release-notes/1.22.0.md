# 1.22.0

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.22.0.

Please see {ref}`ref-component-versions` for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

The 1.22.0 release of Anbox Cloud brings the following features and improvements:

### Core stack improvements
* Support for 64-bit only systems for all supported Android versions.<!--AC-1890, AC-2428-->
* Support for installing relevant 32-bit NVIDIA userspace binaries on AMD64 systems.<!--AC-2450-->
* To allow easier identification and use of instances, you can now explicitly name an instance when creating it. See [How to create an instance](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/instance/create).<!--AC-2395-->
* VHAL enhancements:
    - Configuration returned by the APIs have a new field containing a name and a list of area names for the standard VHAL properties.<!--AC-2290 and AC-2289-->
    - Property values returned by the APIs have a new field containing a list of area names for the standard VHAL properties.<!--AC-2290-->
    - You can replace the Anbox Cloud VHAL implementation with your custom implementation for AAOS images. See [How to use a custom VHAL implementation](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/android/custom_vhal). <!--AC-2371-->

### Streaming stack improvements

* Streaming can now be enabled when launching an instance using the `--enable-streaming` option. Existing installations will require the charm deployment for Anbox Cloud to be manually upgraded to use the new relation between the AMS and the stream agent.

  See [How to stream applications](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/application/stream) and [How to create an instance](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/instance/create) for details on launching stream-enabled instances. See [How to upgrade Anbox Cloud](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/update/upgrade-anbox) for instructions on manually upgrading the relation between the AMS and the stream agent charms.<!--Ac-2460 and AC-2360-->

* VirGL is the default renderer for NVIDIA GPUs with driver version 545 and later. For driver versions earlier than 545 or old NVIDIA GPU architecture such as Turing, Ampere or Ada, EmuGL is used as the default renderer. See [Rendering architecture](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/explanation/rendering-architecture).<!--AC-2459, AC-2270 and AC-2348-->
* Experimental support for [pointer lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) is available with this release. This helps in locking the pointer to a particular browser element, for example, your game window, and limits movement outside the game until the lock is disabled. The pointer lock property must be explicitly enabled on the stream object via the [streaming SDK](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-streaming-sdk).<!--AC-2379-->
* All components of Anbox Cloud upgrade to NVIDIA 550 driver series by default on Ubuntu 22.04 images. For Ubuntu 20.04 images, 535 driver series will be used. <!--AC-2309-->

### Dashboard improvements

The following improvements are available in the Anbox Cloud dashboard for this release:

* Page level guided tours are now available for help in navigating through the dashboard.
* Support for using custom authentication server instead of Ubuntu SSO.
* Custom instance name field in *Create instance* form.
* User experience enhancements to the AAOS control panel:
  - Extending VHAL support to allow setting the geographic location and to be able to provide and revoke consent for enabling APIs in the browser when using maps.
* Enhancements to forms to support AOSP vs AAOS applications.

### Other

* Support for building custom images of Anbox Cloud based on AAOS. See [Custom images](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/explanation/custom-images).<!--AC-2458-->
* Android security updates for May 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - May 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-05-01) for more information).<!--AC-2437-->
* The Android WebView has been updated to [124.0.6367.82](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/04/chrome-for-android-update_24.html).

## Deprecations

See [Deprecation notices](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/reference/deprecation-notices) for a list of deprecations in this release.

## Removed functionality

* Documentation on how to enable VirGL manually is removed because with this release, VirGL is the default renderer for NVIDIA GPUs.

## Known issues

The following known issues exist in the 1.22.0 release and are planned to be fixed in future releases:

* Video playback does not work on 64-bit only systems where the NVIDIA GPU is installed.
* For existing charmed deployments, creating instances with streaming enabled using the `enable-streaming` option requires manually adding the new relation between the AMS and the stream agent charms. See [How to upgrade Anbox Cloud](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/update/upgrade-anbox).
* To work around [issue 13420](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/issues/13420) in LXD, run the following command after deploying a new unit of the [LXD for Anbox Cloud](https://charmhub.io/ams-lxd) charm:

    ```
    juju ssh lxd/n -- lxc storage set ams0 volume.zfs.block_mode=false
    ```

  This workaround needs to be applied to every LXD node deployed using the LXD for Anbox Cloud charm. Otherwise, instances launched via AMS fail with an error similar to the following:

    ```
    Error: Failed creating instance from image: Failed to run: zfs set volsize=3000000512 ams0/containers/ams-cp1pjd7lra53mbq42mug: exit status 255 (cannot set property for 'ams0/containers/ams-cp1pjd7lra53mbq42mug': 'volsize' must be a multiple of volume block size (16K))
    ```

## Bugs fixed

* When using the web dashboard, occasionally the VHAL panel does not appear due to timing issues between the stream client, the stream gateway, the stream agent and the server.<!--AC-2288 and AC-2286-->
* When running Anbox Cloud with VirGL enabled on NVIDIA L4 GPUs, Android stops abruptly on startup with the following error:<!--AC-2335-->
