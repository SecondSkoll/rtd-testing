# 1.23.3

This release is specifically for fixing an issue where an unusually high GPU memory consumption by an Anbox process was reported.

The main trigger for this issue is when multiple clients connect with varying screen resolutions, the system is forced to reallocate GPU buffers of different sizes and does not release memory.

The corresponding bug for this is reported at [LP 2089631](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2089631).

## Upgrade instructions

See {ref}`howto-upgrade-anbox-cloud` and {ref}`howto-upgrade-appliance` for instructions on how to update your Anbox Cloud deployment to the 1.23.3 release.
